## This mod makes all drops from breakable blocks random and multiplied. Inspired by Dream's video series!

### Installation:

1. Required [quilt modloader](https://quiltmc.org/en/), quilt loader must be >= 0.19.1
2. Required [quilted fabric api](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) >= 7.0.2
3. Minecraft 1.20+ versions (tested on 1.21)

### Usage:

The mod is turned off by default so that you can play other worlds without changes. Type command `/randomdrops start` to enable mod. If you want to disable it use command `/randomdrops stop`.

The initial range of values for the number of drops is from 1 to 100. You can change min and max values by using commands `/randomdrops set min <your_amount>` and `/randomdrops set max <your_amount>`

Use command `/randomdrops info` to see actual information about mod usage in your world
  
Use command `/randomdrops reset` to clear drops for your world, than loot-table will start from scratch
